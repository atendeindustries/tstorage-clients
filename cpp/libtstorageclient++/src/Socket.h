 * specified timeout. Since we don't need server functionality here, the
 * `listen()`/`accept()` execution path has been left out.
 *
 * Each `Socket` method which invokes syscalls internally (`recv()` family,
 * `send()`, `skip()`, as well as `connect()`, `close()`, `abort()`,
 * `shutdown()` and `setTimeoutMs()`) sets `errno` on error. To get the `errno`
 * of the last call for more fine-grained error management, use `getErrno()`.
